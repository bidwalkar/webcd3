Web Components over D3.js

Web components using custom elements, have a potential to simplify the HTML pages by shifting most of the programming logic to javascript. D3.js is a very popular library for great visualization. What if we could combine them ?

The minimal web page looks like this

<script src=...> (Include the Javascript file) <br/>

&lt;my-tag attr1="value1"&gt;&lt;/my-tag&gt; (Use the tag) <br/>

Each component has a JS file and a corresponding sample HTML file. <br/>

Following components are available in beta <br/>

1. x-line-chart : Line Chart using D3.  <br/>
