Web Components over D3.js

Web components using custom elements, have a potential to simplify the HTML pages by shifting most of the programming logic to javascript. D3.js is a very popular library for great visualization. What if we could combine them ?

The minimal web page looks like this
<script src=...> (Include the Javascript file)
<my-tag attr1="value1"></my-tag> (Use the tag)

Each component has a JS file and a corresponding sample HTML file.

Following components are available in beta
1. x-line-chart : Line Chart using D3.
